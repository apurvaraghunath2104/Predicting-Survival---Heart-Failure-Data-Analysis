# Predicting-Survival---Heart-Failure-Data-Analysis
Predicting the survival of people with heart failure using the Heart Failure clinical records dataset

Problem Statement:
Predicting the survival of people with heart failure using the Heart Failure clinical records dataset. By using techniques of classification and clustering in data science, our goal is to predict the death event of people who are likely to die due to heart failure influenced by various factors like age,
high blood pressure, anemia and so on.

Data Collection:
We have used the Heart Failure clinical records dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository. This dataset contains different categorical and numerical values which can be used in predicting the death event using classification and clustering models.  The dataset has very minimal/no missing or redundant data increasing the accuracy of the model performance.

Different variables present in the dataset are listed below: 

● age: age of the patient (years) 
● anaemia: decrease of red blood cells or hemoglobin (boolean) 
● high blood pressure: if the patient has hypertension (boolean) 
● creatinine phosphokinase (CPK): level of the CPK enzyme in the blood (mcg/L) 
● diabetes: if the patient has diabetes (boolean) 
● ejection fraction: percentage of blood leaving the heart at each contraction (percentage) 
● platelets: platelets in the blood (kiloplatelets/mL) 
● sex: woman or man (binary) 
● serum creatinine: level of serum creatinine in the blood (mg/dL) 
● serum sodium: level of serum sodium in the blood (mEq/L) 
● smoking: if the patient smokes or not (boolean) 
● time: follow-up period (days) 
● [target] death event: if the patient deceased during the follow-up period (boolean)
